# A City's Weather

A comprehensive, interactive weather web application using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS which demonstrates proficiency in web development, API integration, and dynamic DOM manipulation.

Utilized the wttr.in weather API and enhanced its data handling with JSON structures to efficiently map weather codes to icons, stored in an external icons.json file. The app dynamically updates based on user input, keeping track of search history, rendering current conditions with personalized icons, and converting between Fahrenheit and Celsius with a toggle button. 

Through JavaScript functions and event listeners, we handled asynchronous API requests, conditional rendering, and DOM updates, which included dynamically loading background images based on weather codes and implementing a counter to track user interactions. 

Additionally, we explored CSS animations to create a lively, responsive design featuring animated clouds and gradient-based weather themes. This project showcases advanced knowledge in full-stack development, object-oriented JavaScript, and responsive, user-centric design â€“ skills highly relevant to building dynamic, data-driven applications in real-world scenarios.
